### api

`api` upload serve must return the uploaded file url, and the url must be in the response body.

```js
res.status(200).json({ url: 'https://example.com/xxx.png' });
```

If you have `responseFormat` prop, the response body will be passed to `responseFormat` function.

```js
const responseFormat = (responseBody) => {
  return {
    url: responseBody.data.url,
  };
};
```

<Callout type="info">
  `api` and `connector` are mutually exclusive, if both are provided, `api` will be used. must be provided one of them.
</Callout>
