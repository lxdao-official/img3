# Img3

Img3 is a Web3 image solution that includes image rendering, upload, Web3 storage SDK adaptors, etc. Img3 is an open-source public good. In this proposal, we will implement it based on IPFS. Buidl in [LXDAO](https://lxdao.io/).

## Features

### Img3

<Img3 /> is a fundamental components for Web3 Apps. It extends HTML <img /> with Web3 decentralization storage, like IPFS. With <Img3 /> you can put ipfs:// in the src and render the image from IPFS with the fastest gateway. Will support ar soon. [@lxdao/img3](./packages/img3/README.md)

### Uploader3

Uploader3 is a React-based Web3 image upload component that supports multiple image uploads, image cropping, and uploading images to Web3 Storage providers (like IPFS). There are two ways for uploading, by using a backend API or the Uploader3 Connector. [@lxdao/uploader3](./packages/uploader3/README.md)

### SDK Connector

Uploader3 Connector is a connector for Uploader3. Currently, it only supports NFT.storage IPFS service provider. [@lxdao/uploader3-connector](./packages/uploader3-connector/README.md)

```
git clone https://github.com/lxdao-official/Img3.git

```

Then open <http://localhost:3001> start developing.
